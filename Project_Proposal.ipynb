    "We are undertaking this project to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting housing prices and to identify the key factors that influence housing prices. The steps we will take to complete the project are as follows:<br>\n",
    "Data preprocessing: We will download the two housing price datasets from Kaggle and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.<br>\n",
    "Feature selection: We will explore the datasets to identify the most relevant features for housing price prediction using techniques such as correlation analysis and domain knowledge.<br>\n",

    "BOSTON HOUSING:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunjangir245/boston-housing-dataset <br>\n",
    "Model training and evaluation: We will split the datasets into training and testing sets, and train the selected machine learning algorithms (random forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and decision trees) using the training data. We will then evaluate the performance of each algorithm using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared on the testing data.<br>\n",
    "Model comparison: We will compare the performance of the different algorithms across both datasets to identify the best-performing algorithm for housing price prediction.<br>\n",
    "Feature importance analysis: We will analyze the importance of different features in predicting housing prices using techniques such as permutation importance and feature importance scores provided by the algorithms.\n",
    "The code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation will be implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. We will not be defining new algorithms, but rather using the existing implementations provided by these libraries.<br>"
